The user registry API is used to create and manage an AgStack user account. The API is built using the Python framework, Flask, where user information is stored. Receive an access token (`access_token`), refresh token (`refresh_token`), and domain ID (`domain_id`). For authentication, the `flask-jwt-extended` package is used to decode the JSON Web Token (JWT).
